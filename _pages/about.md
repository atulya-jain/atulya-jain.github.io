I am a PhD candidate in the Economics and Decision Sciences department at <a href="https://www.hec.edu/en/faculty-research/faculty-directory/faculty-member/jain-atulya">  HEC Paris</a>. I am very fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/tristantomala2/home?authuser=0"> Tristan Tomala</a>. My research interests lie in microeconomic theory, with a focus on information economics, behavioral economics, and dynamic games.  For more information, please see my CV  <a href="https://atulya-jain.github.io/files/resume_jain.pdf"> here</a>.

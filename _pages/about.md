I am a Postdoctoral researcher  at the Institute for Microeconomics at the <a href="https://econtribute.de/people/atulya-jain/">  University of Bonn</a>. My research interests lie in microeconomic theory, with a focus on information economics, behavioral economics, and dynamic games.  I'm always happy to chat and exchange ideasâ€”feel free to reach out to me at <a href="mailto:ajain@uni-bonn.de">ajain@uni-bonn.de</a>.
